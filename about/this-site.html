      As it turns out, people are often interested in learning more about my site's design and structure. I occasionally receive correspondence from other programmers and students asking me how I built it, what makes it tick, etc. I decided it was time to write everything down in one place so that I can simply link to it the next time somebody asks.

        To make this fun, let's sort-of pretend I'm actually responding to someone who happens to chat in a very structured way like a magazine interview after it has gone through the editing process.

        P.S. No, I don't find any of your messages annoying. It's very flattering. :)

      <strong>I really like what you've done with your site. What did you use to make it? Is it WordPress? You see, I'm interested in making my own website and I hear WordPress is great for...</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-left">
      Nope!
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-left">
      My website is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a really fun and mature open-source static site generator written in Ruby.
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-right">
      <strong>What does that mean?</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-left">
      Think of Jekyll as a CMS, like WordPress, but it's not hosted anywhere in the cloud. Instead, it's a program you run on your computer that reads in a directory structure laid out in a mostly opinionated manner, then processes all your content (blog posts, pages, images, other static assets such as CSS) and renders it all into a static set of files and folders that you can then shove into a server and host like any other static site.
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-right">
      <strong>Wow, that seems like a ton of work to run a website and blog. Do you copy all these files over manually each time?</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-left">
      No, it's not too much work if you can use Git.
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-left">
      You see, <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> comes with <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/">native Jekyll support</a>. This means that I create a repo out of a Jekyll-generated directory structure, and push to it whenever I want to update something. GitHub runs a build, and starts serving the latest version of the site within seconds.
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-left">
      It's pretty seamless once you get it set up.
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-right">
      <strong>Ah, that's convenient. So, is there a blogging UI of some sort?</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-left">
      No. Unfortunately, you will need to write and edit your posts directly, using a text editor.
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-right">
      <strong>In HTML!?</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-left">
      Oh no no! Fortunately, you can use Markdown (and other markup languages), which is the same language used to format text on a plethora of sites, such as Stack Exchange and Reddit.
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-left">
      Along with a ton of other features, Jekyll also comes with the <a href="http://liquidmarkup.org">Liquid Templating Engine</a> pre-configured, so you can use templates and <em>not</em> have to copy-paste your site header across all your pages. It's pretty nice.
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-right">
      <strong>Okay, you're really selling me on this Jekyll thing.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-left">
      But wait, there's more!
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-left">
      WordPress and other website/blog backend systems generate webpages on the fly as requested. This requires you to pay for server time to keep your site up and running. It's not super expensive, but GitHub Pages is FREE. All I pay for is my domain (annual, inexpensive, personally using <a href="https://affiliate.namecheap.com/?affId=73644">Namecheap</a>). This is optional, and you can host your site on a free GitHub subdomain (username.github.io) instead if you prefer.
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-left">
      And since Jekyll only builds the site <em>once</em> every time you update your content, pages are served in a snap. WordPress is fantastic, but Jekyll (and other site generators) is better IMO, especially if you're a programmer.
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-right">
      <strong>So how did you go about designing <em>your</em> site? Is the code available somewhere?</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-left">
      Source code is <a href="https://github.com/Antrikshy/antrikshy.github.io">available here</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-left">
      I built this site back when using Jekyll themes meant cloning an empty repo from someone and adding your posts and pages to it. Now, it's possible to install themes via Ruby gems, apparently.
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-left">
      Anyways, I had only intended to make a blog. So I started off with the <a href="http://getpoole.com">Poole theme</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a> (of Bootstrap fame). You can see Poole's design influences <a href="/blog">on my blog</a>, still. A year or so later, I decided to take down my old, static portfolio site and re-do the whole thing as a new, Frankenstein'd extension of my Jekyll blog. I peppered in a bunch of frameworks and made the monstrosity that this site is today. The code is as clean, readable and maintainable as can be, but digging into it for the first time may not be easy. Feel free to take inspiration from my design, folder layout etc.
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform pull-left">
      Jekyll is highly opinionated, yet rather flexible in its own way; this is just my way of using it.
