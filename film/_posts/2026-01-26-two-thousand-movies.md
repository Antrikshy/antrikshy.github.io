I started this blog over five years ago. In the [introductory post](/film/introducing-antrikshs-film-blog), I decided to record five movies around my 1,000th movie rated on IMDb.

I've been rating movies since around the age of 16, which was when I first started *using* IMDb ratings for reference. So, this only counts movies I've watched and rewatched since then.

Years later, I just hit 2,000 and figured I should immortalize the five titles leading up to this for no reason.

**Film 1995:** *Bring Her Back*  
**Film 1996:** *The Surfer*  
**Film 1997:** *The Rip*  
**Film 1998:** *Infernal Affairs*  
**Film 1999:** *Decision to Leave*  
**Film 2000:** *Seven Samurai*

Only feature films are included in the count, and there is always a minuscule chance I forget to rate something.
