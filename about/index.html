    <p class="about-longform text-indent">
      I am a software development engineer at Amazon and a recent graduate from UC San Diego with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am highly driven as a software engineer, and try to write highly readable, maintainable and efficient code. I look forward to a career of designing delightful experiences that touch many lives.

    <p class="about-longform text-indent">
      I come from Mumbai. After a two year stay in Phnom Penh, I moved to San Diego for university in 2012. There, I worked with <a href="https://learningequality.org">Learning Equality</a>, the minds behind KA Lite - an offline deployment of Khan Academy - and the <a href="https://learningequality.org/kolibri">Kolibri</a> learning platform. I also did some web development for <a href="http://legday.co">LegDay</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform text-indent">
      Meanwhile, I have worked on numerous personal projects; some small, some big. My portfolio includes an assortment of little scripts, libraries and tinkerings. It also includes <a href="http://quibbler.co">Quibbler.co</a>, an experimental group chat experience that allows anybody to throw ephemeral messages anonymously into the void.
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform text-indent">
      In the summer of 2015, I worked as a software engineering intern at Amazon's Seattle headquarters. There, I gained my first experiences of working with enterprise scale web application development. I owned the development of a critical part of a new project cooked up by the Warehouse Deals & Liquidations team.
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform text-indent">
      Since the fall of 2016, I have been working full-time as a software engineer at Amazon Music in Seattle.
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform text-indent">
      I have travelled around India and south-east Asia quite a bit. Other than programming and design, I am very enthusiastic about video games and movies.
