During the marketing and release cycle of this movie, I didn’t have high hopes. A Predator movie with a non-English-speaking alien as the protagonist? I had doubts.

It’s a small story that takes place over a short period of time. And in this little tale, every detail is perfect. There are loads of set-ups and payoffs. Multiple characters' arcs are surprisingly poignant. One of them is of a species that have so far been portrayed as cold, not-so-relatable killing machines.

The inclusion of Wayland-Yutani was icing on the cake.

Dan Trachtenberg is leading a Renaissance era for this franchise.

**9/10 ★★★★★★★★★★**
