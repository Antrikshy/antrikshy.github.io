In the last 8 or so years, I have watched and rated at least 1001 films* on IMDb. This covers all my movie-viewing experience to date since about the age of 16, maybe 17. In this time, the thought of writing down movie reviews, perhaps loose thoughts... *something*, has crossed my mind more than once. Usually, my internal counter argument was that it was too late to start now, that it would always feel somehow incomplete *not* having a written record of all these years.

Oh well. Hindsight is 20/20. I have grown to enjoy writing more than I ever have, over the last couple of years. And I figured 1001-movies-rated milestone was as good a time as any to embark on this journey.

My other concern was all this becoming a chore. That's still a concern, honestly. And I'll need to plan around it. I'll try my best to pick and choose topics that don't force me into a schedule, and I should be fine.

I'm getting into this without a solid plan. But at the moment, I feel confident about two things:

1. This will be a collection of essays.
2. Proper movie reviews will likely be uncommon.

At the time of this writing, I have genuinely just finished watching (and rating) 1001 movie titles on IMDb, but because I am unsure how far this will go, I am unlikely to publish this until I have at least one or two essays ready to go.

**Just to etch this in stone somewhere:**

**Film 997:** Frozen II  
**Film 998:** Onward  
**Film 999:** Toy Story 4  
**Film 1000:** 2001: A Space Odyssey  
**Film 1001:** Hamilton

<small>\* Feature films. Except any I may have genuinely forgotten to rate, but there are likely only a handful of those.</small>
