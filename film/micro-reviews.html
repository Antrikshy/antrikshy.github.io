<h1>Micro Reviews</h1>
<p>I've rated every movie I've watched since I was about 16. I don't write reviews to avoid turning it into a chore. Nevertheless, occasionally, I come across a movie that provokes enough thought to justify jotting a few of them down.</p>
<ul>
  {% for post in site.categories["micro-review"] %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url | relative_url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
