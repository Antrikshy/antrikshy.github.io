I finished this build in December, and didn't get around to posting it online until now. It's a pretty fine looking build, so I decided I must share. The aesthetic took some work. Fitting the self-imposed constraints around the form factor and the color scheme was not an easy task.

## Background

I first built a PC in early 2015, which still ran just fine, and played most of my games at 1440p, high settings. But I remember the process of building a PC to be really fun, and I wanted to go through it again. So I decided to sell the previous build for parts and build a whole new PC from scratch (only reusing storage from the previous build).

I was a lot more patient with the research, part selection and shipping times this time around because I already had a working gaming PC. I wanted to go with a distinct color scheme. I like the white plus color builds I see from time to time on Reddit, and figured I'd go with white and red to match some of the furniture in my living room. Compact form factor was a must, because I can't imagine having a PC in my home that's larger than the micro-ATX form factor.

Gigabyte deserves a shoutout for being the only Nvidia partner to release RTX GPUs with white coolers at launch. I hope I see a day when more PC part brands have white variants of their parts (or better yet, red and white).

### Hard Mode Color Scheme

Turns out it's very easy to find parts for *black* and red builds, which I despise (sorry). *White* and red, not very much. There are barely any cases or motherboards that come with that color scheme out of the box, especially in the micro-ATX size.

I planned the build as a mostly-white-some-black build, with hopefully enough red accents that I'd be able to call it a white and red PC. My trick was to buy custom PSU cables, red RAM sticks, and hope that the black CPU cooler won't be an eyesore (it wasn't!).

It wasn't easy trying to gauge what the end product would look like without any parts in hand, so I spaced out my purchases a bit, bought the case first, and measured out PSU cable lengths in it.

After some deliberation, I decided on CableMod's ModMesh with Pro upgrades. I'm very glad I did, because the colors are super vibrant and they're absolutely beautiful cables overall. As a bonus, the included cable combs mean they basically come pre-managed, eliminating the need to straighten them out later. Their ModFlex cables are not advertised to have the same vibrant colors, and don't even come in the same bright red color that I used for some of my sleeving, as I learned later.

### The PSU Hiccup

There was a small complication related to the 550W PSU I bought not having enough sockets for my custom cables (details in [this Reddit post](https://redd.it/a24mzj)), which required me to swap for an unnecessarily higher wattage version and wait for it to ship. Other than that, the build went smoothly and the PC turned on the first time!
